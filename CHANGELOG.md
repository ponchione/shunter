# Changelog

Shunter uses source versions from `VERSION` and release tags named `vX.Y.Z`.

## v0.1.1-dev

- Current development line.
- Live subscription join candidate pruning now uses required range filters on the opposite joined side when that side's join column is indexed.
- Live subscription delta candidate pruning now uses range predicates instead of table-wide fallback when the predicate shape is safely range-constrained.
- Live subscription initial and final snapshots now use matching single-column indexes for equality and compound single-table filters.
- One-off and declared single-table queries now use matching composite indexes for multi-column `ORDER BY`, including mixed directions.
- One-off and declared multi-way join queries now use matching single-column indexes when probing joined relations.
- One-off and declared SQL queries now support query-only multi-way joins while live subscriptions continue to reject them.
- One-off and declared SQL queries now support inner-join `WHERE` column equality filters while live subscription admission keeps rejecting them.
- Generated TypeScript clients now include a table-name-to-row-type map and a table subscriber callback type derived from it.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-05

- First Shunter release suitable for use as a normal Go module dependency.
- Published Shunter's WebSocket fork as `github.com/ponchione/websocket v1.8.15-shunter.1` and removed the downstream-only `replace` requirement.
- Added `Runtime.WaitUntilDurable` for app-owned durable acknowledgements.
- Added root `IndexBound`, `Inclusive`, `Exclusive`, `UnboundedLow`, `UnboundedHigh`, and index key helpers.
- Added indexed local reads through `LocalReadView.SeekIndex` and `LocalReadView.SeekIndexRange`.
- Added indexed reducer reads through `ReducerDB.SeekIndex` and `ReducerDB.SeekIndexRange`.
- Added root aliases for reducer-facing `ReducerDB`, `Value`, `ProductValue`, `RowID`, and `TxID`.
- Gzip-negotiated protocol connections now gzip-compress post-handshake server messages while keeping client messages uncompressed.
- Pinned one-off aggregate empty-input semantics for `COUNT` and `SUM`.
- Added `shunter.CheckDataDirCompatibility` for app-owned offline startup schema preflights.
- Added `shunter.RunDataDirMigrations` for app-owned offline executable migrations.
- Added `shunter.RunModuleDataDirMigrations` for offline execution of hooks registered with `Module.MigrationHook`.
- Added app-owned startup migration hooks through `Module.MigrationHook`.
- Tightened generated TypeScript client callback types to use contract-derived table, reducer, and executable declared query/view name unions.
- Improved startup snapshot schema mismatch diagnostics to report multiple structural differences in one failure.
- Added backup/restore guidance to dry-run contract migration plans for blocking or data-rewrite changes.
- Added reusable offline `DataDir` backup and restore helpers for app-owned binaries.
- Added generic CLI commands for offline runtime `DataDir` backup and restore.
- Added runtime snapshot creation and commit log compaction helpers for app-owned maintenance workflows.
- Added reusable runtime and host health/readiness inspection helpers.
- Added `Host.ListenAndServe` for app-owned serving of multi-module hosts.
- Added app-owned contract export and runtime-to-codegen file helpers in `contractworkflow`.
- Added narrow `OFFSET <unsigned-integer>` support for one-off SQL and declared queries.
- Added narrow `ORDER BY` support for unique projection output names in one-off SQL and declared queries.
- Added multi-column `ORDER BY` support for one-off SQL and executable declared queries.
- Added aggregate output alias `ORDER BY` support for one-off SQL and executable declared queries.
- One-off single-table `ORDER BY <column> ASC`/`DESC` can now scan a matching single-column index while rechecking filters and visibility.
- Added narrow `COUNT(<column>)` support for one-off SQL and declared queries.
- Added narrow `SUM(<numeric-column>)` support for one-off SQL and declared queries.
- Reject commits before state mutation when the executor TxID allocator is exhausted.
- Reject reducer registration before reducer ID allocation can wrap.
- Fixed store index keys so caller-owned `bytes` and `arrayString` values cannot mutate committed index entries after insert.
