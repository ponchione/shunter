# Next Session Handoff

Use this file to start the next parity / TECH-DEBT agent with no prior chat context.

Hosted-runtime planning uses `HOSTED_RUNTIME_PLANNING_HANDOFF.md` instead.

## Startup

Required reading before editing:

1. `RTK.md`
2. This file

Then inspect live code with Go tools:

```bash
rtk go doc ./subscription.Manager
rtk go list -json ./subscription ./protocol ./query/sql ./executor
```

Open `TECH-DEBT.md` only if you need the broader backlog. Open `docs/decomposition/004-subscriptions/SPEC-004-subscriptions.md` or `docs/decomposition/005-protocol/SPEC-005-protocol.md` only for a specific contract question.

Use `rtk` for every shell command, including git. Do not push unless explicitly asked.

## Current Objective

Scout for the next bounded OI-002 subscription/runtime residual. There is no queued target.

Start from live code, pick one small observable mismatch, and write the failing test before changing behavior.

## Closed Guardrails

Do not reopen `P0-SUBSCRIPTION-001` through `P0-SUBSCRIPTION-033` without fresh failing regression evidence.

Also treat these recently closed surfaces as done unless a new failing test proves otherwise:

- Same-connection reused subscription-hash initial-snapshot elision
- `SubscriptionError.table_id` on request-origin subscribe/unsubscribe errors
- SubscribeSingle / SubscribeMulti compile-origin error text parity
- SubscribeSingle / SubscribeMulti initial-eval error text parity
- UnsubscribeSingle / UnsubscribeMulti final-eval error text parity
- `SELECT *` on `JOIN` rejection text across subscribe and one-off paths
- `Unresolved::Table` literal (`` no such table: `{t}`. If the table exists, it may be marked private. ``) across subscribe (WithSql-wrapped) and one-off (raw)
- `Unresolved::Field` literal (`` `{table}` does not have a field `{field}` ``) across subscribe (WithSql-wrapped) and one-off (raw) — argument order flipped to `(table, field)` to match reference `errors.rs:16`
- `Unsupported::ReturnType` literal (`Column projections are not supported in subscriptions; Subscriptions must return a table type`) unified across the aggregate and column-list subscribe-projection guards at `protocol/handle_subscribe.go::compileSQLQueryString`

If proof is needed, use `rtk git log`, `rtk git show`, and the relevant tests instead of expanding this handoff with closure archaeology.

## Scout Directions

Pick one of these only if live-code evidence produces a concrete failing test:

- Remaining `expr/src/errors.rs` templated literals. Fixed-literal candidates from the `Unresolved`/`InvalidWildcard`/`Unsupported` families are now closed. The remaining reference templates all take non-trivial format parameters and are heavier slices: `InvalidOp` (`:72` `` Invalid binary operator `{op}` for type `{ty}` ``), `InvalidLiteral` (`:88` `` The literal expression `{literal}` cannot be parsed as type `{ty}` ``), `UnexpectedType` (`:104`), `DuplicateName` (`:120`, currently rejected at parser with `ErrUnsupportedSQL` prefix — needs parser→compile-stage move like the `SELECT *` on `JOIN` closure in `3b3b96d`). Each would require a Shunter-side `AlgebraicType`-name formatter or a parser-stage move; verify the exact divergence on a concrete input before opening the slice.
- Parser-admitted SQL operator combinations that compile cleanly but lack one-off or subscribe protocol pins. Scout a specific input shape, not the whole SQL surface.
- Post-commit fanout, QueryID stamping, or durability-gate edge cases in one combined scenario. Existing tests already cover disjoint-table multi-sub fanout and same-connection reused-hash stamping.

Keep the slice bounded: one reference anchor, one input shape, one failing test family.

## Prior Dead Ends

Do not rescout these without fresh evidence:

- Subscription-manager bookkeeping admission text parity. Reference emit sites mostly format Rust tuples with Debug output, so this is not a clean fixed-literal parity slice.
- `TotalHostExecutionDurationMicros` measurement accuracy. Both implementations measure elapsed time from request receipt.
- Cardinality row-limit text parity. Reference uses planner estimates while Shunter uses actual runtime row counts; parity would require a cardinality estimator.
- One-off mutation rejection text. Shunter has no current view-write failure mode that triggers the reference literal.
- Event-table websocket-v2 rejection text. Shunter has no event-table equivalent yet.

## Out Of Scope

- SQL surface widening beyond what the parser already admits
- Fanout/QueryID correlation redesign
- Reopening closed parity rows without fresh failing evidence
- Non-OI-002 tech-debt

## Validation

```bash
rtk go test <touched packages> -count=1 -v
rtk go fmt <touched packages>
rtk go vet <touched packages>
rtk go test ./... -count=1
```

## Doc Follow-Through

After the implementation is green:

- update `TECH-DEBT.md::OI-002` summary only if the closure removes a risk listed there
- rewrite this handoff to the next live target, keeping startup reading minimal and only future-relevant state

## Working Tree Caution

The repo may contain unrelated hosted-runtime planning files and/or broader docs moves. Do not mix those into a TECH-DEBT / OI-002 implementation slice unless the user explicitly asks.
