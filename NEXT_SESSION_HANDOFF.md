# Next session handoff

Use this file to start the next agent on the next real Shunter parity / hardening step with no prior context.

For provenance of closed slices, use `rtk git log` — this file tracks only current state and forward motion. Do not re-narrate closed slices here.

## Current state (live only)

- All OIs referenced in the 2026-04-22 audit chain (OI-008 through OI-012) are closed.
- All OI-001 A1 protocol wire-close slices identified to date are closed: `SubscriptionError` duration field + RequestID/QueryID None parity, `CallReducer` field order, `TransactionUpdate` field order + `EnergyQuantaUsed` u64→u128 width, applied-envelope field order (all four variants), `IdentityToken` rename + field order, `Unsubscribe.SendDropped` removal, `OneOffQueryResponse` rename + field order. All pinned in `protocol/parity_*_test.go`.
- Phase 2 Slice 4 rows-shape cluster (flat `[]SubscriptionUpdate` / `TableName+Rows` vs reference `SubscribeRows` / `DatabaseUpdate` wrapper chain) is closed as documented divergence — `docs/parity-phase2-slice4-rows-shape.md`. Reopening requires a new decision doc that *also* closes SPEC-005 §3.4 `BsatnRowList` row-list deferral. Do not attempt a partial close.
- `cmd/shunter-example` runs schema → commitlog recovery → durability → executor → WebSocket with anonymous auth, subscription fan-out, and a real `*Scheduler` owned by the example.
- Before changing a file, verify against live code — memory/ledger claims can drift.

## Live constraints (carry forward)

- The OI-001 A1 receipt-timestamp seam batch is closed: `SubscriptionError.TotalHostExecutionDurationMicros`, `OneOffQueryResponse.TotalHostExecutionDuration`, `Subscribe{Single,Multi}Applied.TotalHostExecutionDurationMicros`, and `Unsubscribe{Single,Multi}Applied.TotalHostExecutionDurationMicros` now emit measured non-zero microsecond values through the admission / evaluation / one-off paths, and `TransactionUpdate.Timestamp` / `TransactionUpdate.TotalHostExecutionDuration` now carry microseconds to match reference SATS semantics.
- `EnergyQuantaUsed` on the wire is a 16-byte u128 LE that always emits zeros. Shunter has no energy model; widening to honest u128 values is not on the roadmap.
- `cmd/shunter-example` remains on anonymous auth; strict auth wiring is still out of scope for this queue.
- `Scheduler.ReplayFromCommitted` still uses `context.Background()`; a recovered schedule count exceeding the executor inbox capacity would block replay. Inherited backpressure, not introduced here.
- `TECH-DEBT.md` now marks OI-002 / Tier A2 as the next active execution issue; use that as the tie-breaker if stale docs suggest reopening A1 protocol work.
- The first OI-002 fan-out delivery batch is now closed: `subscription/fanout_worker.go` delivers fast-read recipients without global `TxDurable` blocking while confirmed-read recipients still wait, and `subscription/eval.go` now marks eval-failure connections dropped for executor-side cleanup instead of pruning only the failing subscription.
- The OI-002 join/cross-join multiplicity batch is now closed: `subscription.CrossJoin` carries projection-side/self-alias identity, cross joins preserve cartesian multiplicity across bootstrap/one-off/delta paths, and one-off equi-join projection now preserves bag semantics instead of semijoin-style dedup.

## How to frame a session

Work in *batches*, not single slices. One session = one batch. Within a batch, land one commit per slice so each remains reviewable.

1. **Scout once, at the start of the session.** Read the live code surfaces that match the named batch scope, then diff only those against the corresponding reference/docs source. Grep for `parity_`, `documented-divergence`, and the current OI label to filter out already-closed slices. Produce the residual list for that batch only.
2. **Pick the batch's scope boundary** (one OI, or one named follow-on). Write out which items from the residual list fall inside it. Items outside stay for a future session — do not widen mid-batch.
3. **Close each item in turn**, one commit per slice, each with a new `parity_*_test.go` byte-shape pin or a short decision doc under `docs/` matching the Slice 4 / 2γ / subprotocol pattern. Run `rtk go test ./protocol/...` + dependent packages after each, not only at the end.
4. **Stop when** (a) the batch scope is exhausted, (b) the next item would need a new decision doc (stop and write the doc; do not just ship it), or (c) the next item crosses an OI/scope boundary. Do not stop mid-slice because "one slice is enough for today."
5. **Update this file + memory at the end**, then commit and hand off.

Do not open multiple OIs in one batch. Do not reopen closed slices. Do not silently widen into A3 or OI-004/005/006 hardening.

## Next session: OI-002 A2 predicate/runtime follow-on batch

OI-001 A1 is exhausted for both wire-shape and measurement-parity work, and both the first OI-002 fan-out delivery batch and the join/cross-join multiplicity batch are now closed. The next open protocol-adjacent batch stays in OI-002 A2: subscription/runtime parity against `reference/SpacetimeDB/crates/core/src/subscription/`, but should start from the remaining runtime/model gaps rather than reopening those closed slices.

Batch framing:

1. Scout the live subscription surfaces first: `subscription/predicate.go`, `subscription/validate.go`, `subscription/eval.go`, `subscription/manager.go`, `subscription/fanout.go`, `subscription/fanout_worker.go`, plus the protocol compile/admission seams in `protocol/handle_subscribe_*.go`, `protocol/handle_oneoff.go`, and `executor/protocol_inbox_adapter.go`.
2. Diff those against the relevant reference subscription/runtime paths and produce the residual A2 list only. Ignore already-closed fan-out delivery and SQL surface pins unless they expose a fresh runtime mismatch.
3. Prefer the next bounded runtime/model gap after multiplicity closure: predicate normalization / validation drift between accepted SQL shapes and the runtime predicate model is the best current candidate if the scout still confirms it. If not, pick another single reference-backed runtime/model residual such as evaluation-ordering drift. Keep the session inside one such batch.
4. Land one commit per slice with parser/runtime/protocol pins as appropriate, then finish with `rtk go test ./protocol/... ./subscription/... ./executor/...`.

Suggested starting reads for this batch:

- `subscription/predicate.go`
- `subscription/validate.go`
- `subscription/eval.go`
- `subscription/manager.go`
- `subscription/fanout.go`
- `subscription/fanout_worker.go`
- `protocol/handle_subscribe_single.go`
- `protocol/handle_subscribe_multi.go`
- `protocol/handle_oneoff.go`
- `executor/protocol_inbox_adapter.go`

Good candidate seams to scout before choosing the batch:

- predicate normalization / validation drift between accepted SQL shapes and the runtime predicate model
- evaluation-ordering differences that still change user-visible delta sequencing
- any remaining one-off vs subscribe/runtime mismatches after the now-closed multiplicity batch

Stop conditions:

- stop at the first clean batch boundary that would require a new decision doc or would cross into A3 / hardening work
- do not reopen the just-closed fan-out delivery batch, the rows-shape cluster, or A1 wire/message-family work in the same session
- if the scout shows the next meaningful gap is actually A3 or a new documented divergence, write that up here before handing off

Out of scope for this batch: OI-001 A3 recovery/store parity, OI-004/005/006 hardening, rows-shape cluster reopen, strict-auth wiring in `cmd/shunter-example`.

## Follow-on queue (pickable next, one per session)

- **OI-002 A2** — subscription-layer parity against `reference/SpacetimeDB/crates/core/src/subscription/`. Next candidate batch: predicate normalization / validation drift or another reference-backed runtime/model gap after the closed fan-out delivery and multiplicity slices. Do not reopen those closed slices without fresh evidence.
- **OI-001 A3** — recovery / store parity against `reference/SpacetimeDB/crates/core/src/db/`. Batch scope: snapshot/replay invariants beyond what `P0-RECOVERY-*` already covered.
- **Coordinated wrapper-chain + row-list close** (Phase 2 Slice 4 carried-forward deferral). Requires a new decision doc reopening the SPEC-005 §3.4 `BsatnRowList` deferral together with the reference `SubscribeRows` / `DatabaseUpdate` / `TableUpdate` / `CompressableQueryUpdate` / `QueryUpdate` wrapper chain. Scope is large — do not start without a named consumer or a bandwidth trigger (SPEC-005 §3.4 "fixed-schema row delivery bottleneck").
- **Strict-auth wiring in `cmd/shunter-example`**. Currently anonymous-only. Batch scope: JWT identity, token rotation, `IdentityToken` round-trip, upgrade-path handshake.

Pick one follow-on per session and treat it as the batch scope. Do not interleave.

## Startup notes

- Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then `RTK.md` for command rules, then `docs/EXECUTION-ORDER.md` for sequencing.
- Use `rtk git log` for slice provenance; this file is current-state only.
- Before changing a file, verify against live code — memory/ledger claims can drift.
