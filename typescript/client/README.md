# @shunter/client

Status: checked-in v1 SDK runtime foundation.

This package owns the shared TypeScript runtime surface that generated Shunter
bindings import. The current slice includes constants, protocol compatibility
helpers, state and error types, a managed subscription handle primitive, and
typed runtime interfaces. It does not implement the WebSocket connection,
reconnect policy, reducer argument encoding, row decoding, or cache behavior
yet.

Generated module bindings should import types from `@shunter/client` and keep
module-specific table, reducer, query, and view names in the generated file.

## Verification

```bash
rtk npm --prefix typescript/client run test
```
